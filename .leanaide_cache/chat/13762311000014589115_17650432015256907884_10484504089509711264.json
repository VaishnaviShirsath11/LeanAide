By this definition, \\( n \\) is considered even if there exists some \\( r \\) such that \\( n = r + r \\). This can be rewritten as \\( n = 2r \\), since \\( r + r \\) is equivalent to \\( 2 \\times r \\).\n\nGiven this equivalence in the definition, we can directly conclude that the \\( r \\) mentioned in the existential claim fulfills the role of \\( k \\) in our theorem statement. Specifically, if \\( r \\) is the number for which \\( n = r + r \\), then setting \\( k = r \\) satisfies \\( n = 2 \\times k \\).\n\nThus, for the given natural number \\( n \\), there indeed exists a natural number \\( k \\) such that \\( n = 2 \\times k \\), which completes the proof."},

    "### Theorem\n\nFor any natural number $n$, if $n$ is even, then there exists a natural number $k$ such that $n = 2 \\cdot k$.\n\n### Proof\n\nTo prove this theorem, we start by considering the definition of an even number in the context provided. According to the definition given in Lean, a natural number $n$ is considered even if there exists some natural number $r$ such that $n = r + r$. In other words, $n$ can be expressed as the sum of two equal numbers, which implies that $n = 2r$.\n\nGiven this information, the goal is to show that if $n$ is even, then there exists a natural number $k$ such that $n = 2 \\cdot k$. From the definition of evenness, we already have that $n = 2r$ for some natural number $r$. This representation directly suggests that we can choose $k = r$. Consequently, $n$ can be rewritten as $n = 2r = 2k$, satisfying the condition of the theorem.\n\nThus, the existence of such a $k$ (specifically, $k = r$ where $r$ is the number from the evenness condition) demonstrates that any natural number $n$ that is even can indeed be expressed as $2 \\cdot k$ for some natural number $k$. This completes the proof."},
