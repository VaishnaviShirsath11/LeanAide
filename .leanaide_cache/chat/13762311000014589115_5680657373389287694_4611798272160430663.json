    "## Theorem\n\nFor every natural number \\( n \\), 2 divides \\( n \\).\n\n## Proof\n\nThe statement \"2 divides \\( n \\)\" means that there exists an integer \\( k \\) such that \\( n = 2k \\). \n\nHowever, the given theorem is actually incorrect for all natural numbers \\( n \\). In general, 2 does not divide every natural number. \n\nTo clarify, the theorem suggests that for every natural number \\( n \\), it is divisible by 2. This is only true for even numbers. An even number is defined as a number that can be expressed as \\( n = 2k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nFor example:\n- When \\( n = 0 \\), it is divisible by 2 since \\( 0 = 2 \\times 0 \\).\n- When \\( n = 2 \\), it is divisible by 2 since \\( 2 = 2 \\times 1 \\).\n- When \\( n = 3 \\), it is **not** divisible by 2 since there is no integer \\( k \\) such that \\( 3 = 2k \\).\n\nThus, the statement as posed cannot be proved because it is false for odd numbers. \n\nIn Lean, the `sorry` keyword is used as a placeholder for an unfinished proof or a step that needs further justification, indicating that the proof is not yet complete or potentially incorrect."},

    "## Theorem\n\nFor any natural number \\( n \\), 2 divides \\( n \\).\n\n## Proof\n\nThe statement that 2 divides \\( n \\) for any natural number \\( n \\) is not generally true. In fact, the division by 2 would only be guaranteed if \\( n \\) were specifically an even number. The theorem as presented is incorrect as it stands for all natural numbers unconditionally.\n\nTo prove a corrected version of this theorem, we would need to state that for any even natural number \\( n \\), 2 divides \\( n \\). An even number can be defined as any integer of the form \\( n = 2k \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer. The proof would then follow from this definition:\n\n1. Assume \\( n \\) is an even natural number, so \\( n = 2k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n2.

    "Certainly! Below is the statement and proof of the theorem in natural language using markdown.\n\n---\n\n### Theorem\n\nFor every natural number $n$, 2 divides $n(n+1)$.\n\n### Proof\n\nTo prove that $2 \\mid n(n+1)$ for every natural number $n$, we proceed as follows:\n\nConsider the expression $n(n+1)$. Notice that $n(n+1)$ is the product of two consecutive integers, namely $n$ and $n+1$.\n\n#### Key Observation:\n\n- One of these two consecutive integers must be even. This is due to the fact that even and odd numbers alternate on the number line. Therefore, among any two consecutive integers, one is necessarily even.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\n- If one of the integers $n$ or $n+1$ is even, then their product $n(n+1)$ is divisible by 2. This is because the product of an even number with any integer is itself even, which is precisely the condition for divisibility by 2.\n\nThus, we can conclude that for every natural number $n$, the product $n(n+1)$ is divisible by 2. Therefore, $2 \\mid n(n+1)$.\n\n---"},

    "**Theorem:** For any natural number $n$, the number 2 divides a particular expression or number associated with $n$ (specified in detail in the proof).\n\n**Proof:** \n\nTo prove this theorem, we need to show that 2 divides the given expression or number for all natural numbers $n$. This means there exists an integer $k$ such that the expression is equal to $2k$. \n\nSince the specific expression associated with $n$ is omitted in the Lean code and proof, we can only provide a general outline of how such a proof might proceed:\n\n1. **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement is true for some natural number $n = k$, i.e., 2 divides the expression when $n = k$.\n2. **Base Case:** Verify the statement for a base case, usually $n = 0$ or $n = 1$. For this base case, explicitly demonstrate that 2 divides the expression.\n3. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume the statement is true for $n = k$. That is, assume there exists an integer $m$ such that the expression associated with $n = k$ is equal to $2m$.\n4. **Inductive Conclusion:** Prove that the statement is true for $n = k + 1$ by showing there is an integer $m'$ such that the expression for $n = k + 1$ equals $2m'$. \n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, if both the base case and the inductive step are proven, the statement holds for all natural numbers $n$. \n\nThe actual details of the expression and the division by 2 need to be specified for a complete proof, which is suppressed in this Lean code example."},
