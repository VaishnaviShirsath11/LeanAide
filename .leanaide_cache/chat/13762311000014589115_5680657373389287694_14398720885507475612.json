    "## Theorem\n\nFor every natural number \\( n \\), it holds that \\( n < n + 1 \\).\n\n## Proof\n\nWe will prove the theorem by mathematical induction on the natural number \\( n \\).\n\n### Base Case\n\nConsider the base case where \\( n = 0 \\). We need to show that \\( 0 < 0 + 1 \\), which simplifies to \\( 0 < 1 \\). This inequality is true because 1 is greater than 0.\n\n### Inductive Step\n\nAssume that for some arbitrary natural number \\( k \\), the statement \\( k < k + 1 \\) holds true. This is our inductive hypothesis.\n\nWe need to show that \\( k + 1 < (k + 1) + 1 \\). Simplifying the right side, we get \\( k + 1 < k + 2 \\).\n\nSince \\( k < k + 1 \\) by the inductive hypothesis, adding 1 to both sides of this inequality yields \\( k + 1 < k + 2 \\). This completes the inductive step.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince both the base case and the inductive step have been established, by the principle of mathematical induction, the theorem holds for all natural numbers \\( n \\). Therefore, for every natural number \\( n \\), the inequality \\( n < n + 1 \\) is true."},
