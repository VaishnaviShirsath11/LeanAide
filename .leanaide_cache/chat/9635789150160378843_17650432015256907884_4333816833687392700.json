    "### Theorem Statement\n\nFor a natural number \\( n \\), if \\( n \\) is an even number, then there exists an integer \\( k \\) such that \\( n = 2 \\times k \\).\n\n### Proof\n\nTo prove this theorem, we will use the definition of an \"even number\" as given in Lean, which states that an element \\( a \\) of a type \\( \\alpha \\) satisfies `Even a` if there exists some \\( r \\) such that \\( a = r + r \\).\n\n1. **Assumption**: Let \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\) and assume that \\( n \\) is even. According to the definition, this means there exists an integer \\( r \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   n = r + r\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rewrite as a product**: We can rewrite the equation \\( n = r + r \\) as:\n   \\[\n   n = 2 \\cdot r\n   \\]\n\n3. **Existence of \\( k \\)**: Take \\( k = r \\). Clearly, \\( k \\) is an integer because it is derived from the integer \\( r \\). By substituting \\( k \\) for \\( r \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   n = 2 \\cdot k\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Thus, we have demonstrated the existence of an integer \\( k \\) such that \\( n = 2k \\). This completes the proof that for any natural number \\( n \\), if \\( n \\) is even, there exists an integer \\( k \\) satisfying \\( n = 2 \\times k \\). \n\nThis proof relies directly on the definition of an even number given in Lean, using basic properties of equality and arithmetic."},
