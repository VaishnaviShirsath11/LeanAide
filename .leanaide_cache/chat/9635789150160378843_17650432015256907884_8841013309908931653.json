    "### Theorem\n\nFor a natural number \\( n \\), if \\( n \\) is even, then there exists some natural number \\( k \\) such that \\( n = 2 \\times k \\).\n\n### Proof\n\nTo prove this theorem, we start by unpacking the definition of an even natural number. By definition, a natural number \\( n \\) is considered even if there exists some integer \\( r \\) such that \\( n = r + r \\). This can be rewritten as \\( n = 2r \\), which means \\( n \\) is an even number because itâ€™s exactly twice another number \\( r \\).\n\nThe theorem asks us to show that the existence of such an \\( r \\) implies the existence of an integer \\( k \\) such that \\( n = 2 \\times k \\). This directly follows from the definition itself. Given that \\( n = 2r \\), we can set \\( k = r \\), fulfilling the requirement of the statement \\( n = 2 \\times k \\).\n\nThus, the proof is direct and confirms that for any even natural number \\( n \\), there always exists a natural number \\( k \\) such that \\( n = 2 \\times k \\)."},

    "### Theorem\n\nFor any natural number $n$, if $n$ is an even number according to the definition, then there exists a natural number $k$ such that $n = 2k$.\n\n### Proof\n\nTo prove this theorem, we need to show that if a natural number $n$ is even, then it can be expressed as $n = 2k$ for some natural number $k$.\n\n1. **Definition of Even**: According to the given Lean definition, an element $a$ of a type with addition satisfies `Even a` if there exists some $r$ such that $a = r + r$. For natural numbers, this implies that $n$ is even if $n = r + r$ for some natural number $r$.\n\n2. **Existence of $k$**: If $n$ is even, by the definition, there exists a natural number $r$ such that $n = r + r$. Let $r = k$. Then, we have $n = k + k = 2k$ for some natural number $k = r$.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: We have shown that if $n$ is even, then we can find a natural number $k$ where $n = 2k$. Thus, the theorem is proven.\n\nThis proof directly utilizes the definition of an even number and demonstrates the equivalence of this definition to the traditional form of an even number being expressible as $n = 2k$."},
