    "**Theorem:** The set of all odd natural numbers is infinite.\n\n**Proof:** \n\nTo prove this, we will demonstrate that the set of all odd natural numbers cannot be finite. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the set of odd natural numbers is finite. A finite set of natural numbers would have a maximum element because finite subsets of natural numbers are bounded above and the natural numbers are well-ordered.\n\nHowever, consider any such maximum odd number, say $n_{\\max}$. The number $n_{\\max} + 2$ is also odd and greater than $n_{\\max}$. This implies that $n_{\\max}$ cannot indeed be the maximum, as we have found an odd number greater than it. This contradiction implies the initial assumption that the set of odd natural numbers is finite must be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the set of odd natural numbers is infinite."},

    "### Theorem\n\nThe set of all odd natural numbers is infinite.\n\n### Proof\n\nTo prove this theorem, we need to show that the set \\( S = \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid n \\% 2 = 1 \\} \\) is infinite, where % denotes the modulo operation.\n\n1. **Understanding the Set**: The set \\( S \\) consists of all natural numbers \\( n \\) such that when \\( n \\) is divided by 2, the remainder is 1. Hence, \\( S \\) is the set of odd natural numbers: \\( \\{1, 3, 5, 7, \\ldots\\} \\).\n\n2. **Infinite Set Criterion**: A set is defined as infinite if it cannot be put into a one-to-one correspondence with a finite set, or if it cannot be listed in a finite sequence.\n\n3. **Argument for Infiniteness**: To demonstrate that \\( S \\) is infinite, consider the following:\n\n   - For any odd number \\( n \\), the number \\( n + 2 \\) is also odd. This means that if \\( n \\in S \\), then \\( n + 2 \\in S \\), establishing a recursive pattern.\n   \n   - Assume, for contradiction, that \\( S \\) is finite. Then there would exist a largest odd number \\( m \\in S \\). However, \\( m + 2 \\) is also in \\( S \\) and is larger than \\( m \\), which contradicts the assumption that \\( m \\) is the largest odd element in \\( S \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our assumption must be false, and \\( S \\) cannot be finite. Thus, the set of odd natural numbers is indeed infinite. \n\nThis completes the proof that the set of odd natural numbers is infinite."},

If a set is finite, it means there is a bijection between the set and a finite subset of the natural numbers $\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, m\\}$ for some non-negative integer $m$.\n\nHowever, consider the function $f : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid n \\mod 2 = 1 \\}$ defined by $f(k) = 2k + 1$. This function maps every natural number $k$ to an odd number $2k + 1$. \n\nThe function $f$ is clearly injective: if $f(k_1) = f(k_2)$ for $k_1, k_2 \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then $2k_1 + 1 = 2k_2 + 1$, which implies $2k_1 = 2k_2$ and thus $k_1 = k_2$. \n\nTherefore, we can select infinitely many distinct odd numbers using $f(k) = 2k + 1$ simply by varying $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, such as $1, 3, 5, 7, \\ldots$, each $f(k)$ will give a unique odd number. This contradicts the assumption that the set of odd numbers is finite since we found an injective function from the infinite set $\\mathbb{N}$ into our set, implying our set must also be infinite.\n\nThus, the set of odd natural numbers is indeed infinite."},

    "### Theorem\n\nThe set of all odd natural numbers is infinite.\n\n### Proof\n\nTo prove that the set of all odd natural numbers is infinite, we must show that it is not finite. A set is finite if there exists a bijection between the set and a natural number set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$ for some natural number $n$. Conversely, a set is infinite if such a bijection does not exist.\n\nConsider the set $S = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid n \\% 2 = 1\\}$, which contains all natural numbers that are odd. To demonstrate that $S$ is infinite, consider the function $f: \\mathbb{N} \\to S$ defined by $f(n) = 2n + 1$. This function maps each natural number $n$ to an odd number. Specifically, for any natural number $n$, $2n + 1$ is odd because it can be expressed as $2k + 1$ where $k = n$.\n\nNow, we need to show that $f$ is both injective and not surjective:\n\n1. **Injectivity**: Suppose $f(n_1) = f(n_2)$ for natural numbers $n_1$ and $n_2$. Then $2n_1 + 1 = 2n_2 + 1$. Simplifying, we get $2n_1 = 2n_2$, and dividing both sides by 2 gives $n_1 = n_2$. Thus, $f$ is injective.\n\n2. **Not surjective** (in terms of finiteness): It suffices to provide an argument that no finite subset of natural numbers can cover all odd numbers generated by $f$. Assume, for contradiction, that $S$ is finite, so its elements are $\\{2k + 1 \\mid k \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\} \\}$ for some $n$. However, $f(n+1) = 2(n+1) + 1 = 2n + 3$ is an odd number not in the considered finite subset, illustrating a contradiction with the assumption that the set covers all odd numbers. Thus, $S$ must be infinite.\n\nSince there is no finite subset of natural numbers that can cover all elements of $S$, the set of all odd natural numbers cannot be finite. Therefore, the set $\\{n \\mid n \\% 2 = 1\\}$ is infinite. $\\blacksquare$"},
