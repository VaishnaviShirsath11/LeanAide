Then the product becomes \\( n \\times 2 \\).\n\n4. **Check Divisibility**: Since \\( n \\times 2 = 2n \\), it is clear that \\( 2 \\) divides \\( 2n \\) because \\( 2n = 2 \\times n \\), where \\( n \\) is an integer.\n\nTherefore, for any natural number \\( n \\), choosing \\( k = 2 \\) satisfies the condition that \\( 2 \\) divides \\( n \\times k \\).
