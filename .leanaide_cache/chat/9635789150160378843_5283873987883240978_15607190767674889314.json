    "Assume \\( n \\) is an even natural number. By definition, \\( n \\) is even if there exists an integer \\( m \\) such that \\( n = 2m \\). \n\nSince \\( m \\) is an integer and \\( n \\) is a natural number, we also have that \\( m \\) must be a non-negative integer (i.e., \\( m \\geq 0 \\)), as the product of 2 and any negative integer would result in a negative integer, which contradicts the assumption that \\( n \\) is a natural number.\n\nThus, set \\( k = m \\). Then \\( k \\) is a natural number (as \\( m \\geq 0 \\)) and we have \\( n = 2k \\), which completes the proof."},
