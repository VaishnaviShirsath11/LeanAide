    "## Theorem\n\nFor every natural number \\( n \\), the product \\( n \\times (n + 1) \\) is even.\n\n## Proof\n\nTo prove that \\( n \\times (n + 1) \\) is even for every natural number \\( n \\), we need to demonstrate that there exists some integer \\( r \\) such that:\n\n\\[\nn \\times (n + 1) = r + r = 2r\n\\]\n\nConsider the expression \\( n \\times (n + 1) \\). This is the product of two consecutive integers. We know that among any two consecutive integers, one of them must be even because every second integer is even. Let's examine the two cases:\n\n1. **Case 1**: \\( n \\) is even.\n\n   If \\( n \\) is even, then there exists an integer \\( k \\) such that \\( n = 2k \\). Substituting this into our expression, we have:\n\n   \\[\n   n \\times (n + 1) = 2k \\times (2k + 1) = 2k \\times (2k + 1)\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\( 2k \\) is even, multiplying it by any integer (in this case, \\( (2k + 1) \\)) will produce an even result. Therefore, \\( n \\times (n + 1) \\) is even.\n\n2. **Case 2**: \\( n + 1 \\) is even.\n\n   If \\( n + 1 \\) is even, there exists an integer \\( m \\) such that \\( n + 1 = 2m \\). Thus, we can express \\( n \\) as \\( n = 2m - 1 \\). Substituting this into our expression gives:\n\n   \\[\n   n \\times (n + 1) = (2m - 1) \\times 2m = (2m - 1) \\times 2m\n   \\]\n\n   Here, \\( 2m \\) is even, and multiplying it by any integer (in this case, \\( 2m - 1 \\)) will also yield an even result. Therefore, \\( n \\times (n + 1) \\) is even.\n\nSince in both cases, the product \\( n \\times (n + 1) \\) results in an even number, we conclude that for every natural number \\( n \\), the expression \\( n \\times (n + 1) \\) is indeed even. Hence, the theorem is proved."},
