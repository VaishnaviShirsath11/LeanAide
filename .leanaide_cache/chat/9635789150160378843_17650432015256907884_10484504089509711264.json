According to the definition, a natural number \\( n \\) is even if there exists some number \\( r \\) such that \\( n = r + r \\), or equivalently, \\( n = 2r \\).\n\nGiven that \\( n \\) is even, by the definition, there exists a natural number \\( r \\) such that:\n\n\\[\nn = r + r = 2r\n\\]\n\nThe task is to show that there exists a natural number \\( k \\) such that \\( n = 2 \\times k \\). Here, observe that:\n\n\\[\nn = 2r = 2 \\times r\n\\]\n\nBy setting \\( k = r \\), which is itself a natural number, we have:\n\n\\[\nn = 2 \\times k\n\\]\n\nThus, for every natural number \\( n \\) that is even, there exists a natural number \\( k \\) (specifically \\( k = r \\)), satisfying the condition \\( n = 2 \\times k \\).\n\nTherefore, given \\( n \\) is even, we have shown there exists such a \\( k \\) in the natural numbers, completing the proof."},

    "**Theorem:** For any natural number $n$, if $n$ is even, then there exists a natural number $k$ such that $n = 2k$.\n\n**Proof:** Suppose $n$ is a natural number and assume that $n$ is even. By the definition of an even number, this means that there exists some natural number $r$ such that $n = r + r$. \n\nWe can rewrite the expression $r + r$ as $2r$, because adding a number to itself is equivalent to multiplying it by 2. Hence, we have $n = 2r$. \n\nLet $k = r$. Then $k$ is a natural number (since $r$ is a natural number) and $n = 2k$. \n\nTherefore, given that $n$ is even, we have shown there exists a natural number $k$ such that $n = 2k$.
