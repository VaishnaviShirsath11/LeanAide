    "To prove that there are infinitely many even numbers, consider the even numbers defined by the sequence \\(2n\\) where \\(n\\) is a non-negative integer. This sequence is \\(\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, \\ldots\\}\\).\n\nTo show that this set is infinite, observe that for every non-negative integer \\(n\\), there is a corresponding even number \\(2n\\). Moreover, for any given even number \\(2m\\), one can find a larger even number \\(2(m+1) = 2m + 2\\). Thus no finite list can contain all even numbers as for any proposed finite list, you can always find another even number not in that list, specifically by taking the largest even number in the list, say \\(2m\\), and adding 2 to it, yielding \\(2m + 2\\).\n\nTherefore, there are infinitely many even numbers."},
