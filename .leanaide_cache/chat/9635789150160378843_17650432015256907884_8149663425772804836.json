    "## Theorem\nFor any natural number $n$, if $n$ is even, then there exists a natural number $k$ such that $n = 2k$.\n\n## Proof\nTo prove this theorem, we start with the definition: a natural number $n$ is said to be *even* if there exists some natural number $r$ such that $n = r + r$. This can be simplified to $n = 2r$, reflecting the intuitive understanding that even numbers are divisible by 2 without any remainder.\n\nGiven that $n$ satisfies the property of being even, there exists an $r \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that:\n\\[ n = r + r = 2r. \\]\n\nWe need to show there exists a natural number $k$ such that $2k = n$. Observe that in our definition, we can set $k = r$. Therefore, since $n = 2r$, it follows directly that:\n\\[ n = 2k. \\]\nThis proof confirms the existence of such a $k$, thus satisfying the statement of the theorem.\n\nConclusively, for every even natural number $n$, there does indeed exist a natural number $k$ such that $n$ equals twice $k$. This establishes that even numbers in the set of natural numbers can be expressed as the product of 2 and another natural number."},

In this scenario, $r$ is also a natural number because $n$ is the sum of two identical natural numbers, thus $r \\leq n$ and $r$ itself must be a natural number since natural numbers start from $0$ and only include whole non-negative numbers.\n\nSince $n = r + r$, we can rewrite this as $n = 2 \\times r$. Therefore, we can define $k$ to be $r$. So, there exists $k = r$ such that $n = 2 \\times k$.\n\nThus, we have shown that for a natural number $n$ that is even, there exists another natural number $k$ where $n = 2k$.
